# RDESystems_CovidTracker  
This is the Covid Hotspot tracker created for RDE Systems for the NJIT capstone class of 2020. This project is a mobile-friendly web application which tracks COVID-19 infections,deaths, and recoveries and plots them on a map of the
tri-state area. Trend maps for all three indicators are available from a menu and all information is filterable by date, location,
and type of indicator. Maps are kept up to date with the latest information by scraping data from the NYTimes Covid Repository: https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data.
